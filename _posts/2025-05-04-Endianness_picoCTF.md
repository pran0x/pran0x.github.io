### Getting Start

This is kind of tricky. so first we need to download the file represent as flag.c from the source  

here you need to know what it Little Endian and Big Endian. Basically it just converted the text to Hexadecimal format.
Here I use Chat-Gpt to convert the text to little and big endian.
here as a example how its looks like :
TEXT : cercd
LITTLE ENDIAN : 6463726563
BIG ENDIAN : 6365726364
also it can be shows as a 7A676B6F7A. so don't worry
after submit you go your flag. 

### HAPPY HUNTING...........!
